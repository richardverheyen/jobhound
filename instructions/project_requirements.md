# NoCode Marketplace Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview

The NoCode Marketplace is a web-based platform designed to cater to no-code developers and indie hackers looking to sell their applications or startups. The marketplace acts as a central hub where developers can list their no-code startups for sale, simplifying the process of getting exposure to potential buyers. This platform primarily aims to solve several challenges faced by no-code developers, including the need for substantial marketing channels and technical infrastructure to reach the right audience. It offers a niche environment tailored specifically to their needs, enhancing both visibility and the potential for sales.

By building the NoCode Marketplace, we aim to create a dedicated, efficient, and user-friendly space for transactions that is accompanied by robust communication tools. The project's success will be measured by its ability to attract significant listing activity, facilitate purchases through effective buyer-seller interaction, and provide a seamless and secure user experience. The platform's core objective is to support no-code developers by enabling them to monetize their developments more effectively while forming a vibrant community of no-code enthusiasts.
