### Introduction

The backend of the NoCode Marketplace is specially designed to support a seamless online platform for no-code developers and indie hackers. Its primary function is to allow users to list and sell their no-code applications. The backend ensures quick and secure user authentication, data storage, management of listings, and robust communication features. Providing a reliable backbone to the application, the backend plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of this marketplace, paving the way for smooth transactions and interactions between sellers and potential buyers.

### Backend Architecture

The backend architecture of the NoCode Marketplace employs a modern and scalable design framework heavily reliant on Supabase. Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase, acting as the core backend component that manages databases, authentication, and storage processes. This architecture is engineered to cater to a high volume of concurrent users while maintaining robust performance levels. It utilizes SQL databases for structured data handling and supports real-time updates, making it both maintainable and extensible as the application's demands grow.

### Database Management

The NoCode Marketplace utilizes a SQL-based database provided by Supabase. This choice allows structured data storage, ensuring that user profiles, startup listings, and transaction-related information remain well-organized and easily retrievable. The data is structured into tables corresponding to users, listings, and chat interactions, facilitating efficient access and manipulation. Supabase's realtime syncing capabilities ensure that database operations are immediately reflected across the platform, providing accurate and up-to-date information.

### API Design and Endpoints

The application follows a RESTful API design, which is intuitive and widely supported across different platforms and tools. The API endpoints facilitate various operations, such as managing user authentication through Clerk, handling startup listings submissions, and enabling real-time chat functionalities. These endpoints ensure effective communication between the frontend and backend, allowing actions such as fetching listings with specific filters or updating user profiles.
