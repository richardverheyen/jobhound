Job scan analysis operations should complete within 30 seconds
API rate limiting should be implemented to prevent abuse

Scalability

The database design should support up to 100,000 users

Reliability

The system should maintain 99.9% uptime
Failed payments or credit usage operations must be properly logged

Monitoring & Observability

All edge functions must implement proper logging for debugging
Credit usage patterns should be tracked and analyzable
System performance metrics should be collected and monitored
Error rates should be tracked and alertable

Data Management

File uploads should be limited to acceptable resume file formats (.pdf, .docx, etc.)
Maximum file size should be enforced (e.g., 10MB per resume)
Database indexes should be optimized for common query patterns
Historical job scan data should be retained for at least 1 year
