Security Considerations for the Onboarding Flow
Based on the changes I've implemented, let me explain the security measures that make this onboarding flow secure and resistant to abuse:
1. Secure Session Management
The new onboarding flow uses a secure session management approach:

Cryptographically secure random tokens: The session_id is generated using gen_random_bytes(32) which creates a 256-bit random token that is cryptographically secure.
Limited session lifetime: Each onboarding session has a configurable expiration time with a hard maximum limit of 72 hours.
Session status tracking: Sessions have explicit status values (created, active, completed, expired) to prevent reuse of completed sessions.

2. Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies
The RLS policies ensure data can only be accessed by the appropriate users:

Only authenticated users can create onboarding sessions (via the Edge Function)
Resumes, jobs, and job scans created during onboarding can only be accessed by:

The user who owns them after authentication
The specific onboarding session that created them (using the temporary session context)


RLS policies check that the onboarding session is active and not expired

3. Rate Limiting
The Edge Function implements basic IP-based rate limiting to prevent abuse from a single client.
4. Secure Migration of Data
When a user completes onboarding:

The session is marked as completed (preventing future use)
All data is properly transferred to the authenticated user
The onboarding session IDs are removed from the transferred records
Only the specific user who completes onboarding can access the data

5. Validation at Every Step
Multiple validation steps are implemented:

Email format validation (if provided)
Session validity checks before allowing access
Expiration timestamp validation
JWT token validation for authenticated users

6. Automatic Cleanup
A function to automatically expire old sessions prevents orphaned data:

expire_onboarding_sessions() can be scheduled to run periodically

Implementation Notes

Database Changes:

New onboarding_sessions table for secure session management
Foreign key references from operational tables to onboarding sessions
Secure helper functions for creating, validating, and completing onboarding


Edge Functions:

create-onboarding: Creates a secure session for unauthenticated users
set-temporary-session: Associates the current request with a specific session
complete-onboarding: Securely transfers onboarding data to the authenticated user


Security Protections:

Use of SECURITY DEFINER on critical functions
Row-level security throughout
Comprehensive validation
JWT authentication for the completion phase



Key Benefits of This Approach

Frictionless Onboarding: Users can try the service before creating an account
Data Security: All data remains protected by RLS
Abuse Prevention: Rate limiting, expiry, and session validation prevent abuse
Seamless Account Transition: Data is automatically linked to the user account when created
Compliance: Clear data management and privacy considerations

This implementation provides a secure onboarding flow that balances user experience with security, ensuring that your system can't be abused by malicious actors while still allowing legitimate users to experience the application before committing to account creation.
